# Diabetes and Heart Analysis and Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict and analyze the probability of heart disease or diabetes-related health issues by leveraging medical datasets and machine learning techniques.  
The system applies various algorithms, evaluates their performance, and uses data visualization to identify key risk factors.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Power BI
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Histograms, Scatter Plots, Heatmaps
- **Dataset:** Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (and other relevant medical datasets)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing, handling missing values, and preparing datasets for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of patterns and correlations between health parameters.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and others.
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Prediction:** User health data input to predict diabetes or heart disease probability.
